The Data Manager Package
================================
.. include:: definitions.rst
The |pylib_name| package is intended for enabling easy reproducibility of
numerical experiments. Data is stored in a human-readable fashion (whenever 
possible).

A good place to start reading for a high-level overview of the module is :ref:`fundamentals`.
If you just want to get started you can read :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_misc_example0_common.py`.
Alternatively you can use the ready-made design patterns from :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_patterns`.
For more advanced examples you can take a look at :ref:`sphx_glr_gallery_cases`.
